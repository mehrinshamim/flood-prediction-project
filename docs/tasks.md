Given your role in web development for the flood prediction project, here are the tasks you need to focus on:

### Web Application Development Tasks

#### 1. Web Interface Creation
- **Design the User Interface (UI):**
  - Create wireframes and mockups for the web application interface.
  - Ensure the UI is user-friendly and intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.

- **Develop the Flask Application:**
  - Set up the Flask framework and create the necessary project structure.
  - Implement routes and endpoints for data input, prediction results, and visualizations.
  - Develop forms or input methods for users to provide necessary data for flood prediction.

- **Integrate Model Predictions:**
  - Load the trained flood prediction model within the Flask app.
  - Create an endpoint to accept user inputs and return prediction results.
  - Ensure that the prediction process is efficient and returns results quickly.

- **Incorporate Data Visualizations:**
  - Integrate charts and plots generated by the Data Visualization Team into the web app.
  - Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for interactive visualizations.
  - Ensure visualizations are responsive and provide meaningful insights.

#### 2. Deployment
- **Testing:**
  - Perform extensive testing to ensure the web application functions correctly.
  - Test various user scenarios and inputs to ensure robustness.
  - Debug and resolve any issues or bugs identified during testing.

- **Deployment:**
  - Choose a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud) for deploying the web application.
  - Set up the necessary environment and dependencies on the chosen cloud platform.
  - Deploy the Flask application and ensure it is accessible to users.

- **Post-Deployment:**
  - Monitor the application's performance and user feedback.
  - Implement updates and improvements based on feedback and new requirements.
  - Ensure the application remains secure and performs efficiently.

### Additional Considerations
- **Documentation:**
  - Document the development process, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and usage guidelines.
  - Create user guides or help sections to assist users in navigating and using the web application.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Regularly communicate with other teams (Data Visualization, Model Training) to ensure seamless integration of their work into the web app.
  - Participate in team meetings and provide updates on the web development progress.

By following these tasks, you'll be able to develop a functional and user-friendly web application for the flood prediction project.
